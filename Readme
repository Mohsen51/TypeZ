---TypeZ The best way to learn typing---
PROJET A2 WEB

The CodeZZ team has rebuilt a part of its team to always enhance user experience. The web project we developed is a game to learn typing faster.
The project contains 5 pages : The home page, the word game, the letter game, a contact page and an "about us" page.
This website is built to be interactive. There are two games that use Javascript to read keyboard input.
It is built to be responsive, we used Js and CSS to perform this : css allows us to use media queries to adapt content to se size of user's screen,
and Js allows us to buid a burger menu, that is usable and userfriendly on both desktop and mobile browser. Nonetheless, the minimum size to
use our website, nevertheless is 200px.

The website is fully responsive, apart form the about-us page, we used flex-box, but the content doesn't wrap properly.
Plus, we were unable to test the gaming experience on a real phone.
