---TypeZ The best way to learn typing---
PROJET A2 WEB

The CodeZZ team has rebuilt a part of its team to always enhance user experience. The web project we developed is a game to learn typing faster.
The project contains 5 pages : The home page, the word game, the letter game, a contact page and an "about us" page.
This website is built to be interactive. There are two games that use Javascript to read keyboard input.
It is built to be responsive, we used Js and CSS to perform this : css allows us to use media queries to adapt content to se size of user's screen,
and Js allows us to build a burger menu, that is usable and userfriendly on both desktop and mobile browser. Nonetheless, the minimum size to
use our website, nevertheless is 200px.

The website is fully responsive, apart form the about-us page, we used flex-box, but the content doesn't wrap properly.
Plus, we were unable to test the gaming experience on a real phone.

The navigation through the website is eased thanks to the burger menu. It is present in all the web pages, as it is included in the header.
Pages contains a footer too. As there is a footer and a header on all pages, and as we wanted to use similar style for all pages, there is only one
stylesheet, ruling the entire website. Located in the "Style" folder. We could have used php includes to avoid having a copy/paste on all the pages,
but it would have mean to handle a back end, and this was forbidden.
The burger navigation is controlled by Js, so are our too games, and the contact form. Thus we have four Script files, located in the Js folder.
All used images are in a "media" folder.
Finally, pages of our website are in the root folder.

To open the main page, open "index.html".

Good game.
